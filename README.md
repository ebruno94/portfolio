## Description

This simple HTML portfolio webpage was written for Epicodus' independent project day, in HTML and CSS. This webpage was made in order to demonstrate our knowledge in HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, all of which we have learned in the span of 3 days. It was also made for future use. The simple site contains information about me and some of the projects I have worked on.
