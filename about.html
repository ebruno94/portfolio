          <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  My name is Ernest Daryl O. Bruno, and I am a current student of Epicodus in Seattle, WA. </p>
          <br>
          <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before joining Epicodus, I was a full-time student at the University of Washington Seattle with the intent of getting a degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
            I currently have an Associate's Degree in Science which I obtained from Seattle Central College and aspired to become a Civil Engineer at the time.
            I soon realized that Civil Engineering was not for me and so I decided to pursue my long-time dream career in programming.
            UW Seattle's Computer Science and Engineering program has been known to be one of the toughest in the country, and I have experienced this first hand.
            So I jumped ship into Epicodus in hopes of being able to finally achieve my dreams of getting into the tech field and becoming successful in it.
          </p>
          <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I <strong> ENJOY AND LOVE </strong> being physically active, and playing video games -- both for recreational and health purposes.
            I spend at least 1 1/2 hours at the gym lifting weights and doing cardio afterwards, and I go to the gym 5-6 days a week
            If I have extra time in my day, I get into my PC and play video games with some of my friends (both online and in real life) for about an hour or two.
            The rest of time is spent with my family -- parents and 4 other siblings.
          </p>
